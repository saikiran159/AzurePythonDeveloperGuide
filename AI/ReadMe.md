# What is AI? ðŸ¤–

Artificial Intelligence (AI), in simple terms, means making a computer understand the relationships between data attributes and enabling it to take actions based on that understanding.

This concept mirrors what we do in our daily lives. As humans, we have memory to recall past experiences and imagination (relation) to predict future outcomes based on those experiences.

## Examples of Natural Intelligence we see in our Daily Lifes ðŸ“Š

1. **Weight Prediction (AI model: Regression)**
   - We follow a diet plan from a doctor and observe our weight every week or two (data collection).
   - Based on this, we predict how much weight we might gain or lose in the next 12 weeks.

2. **Mall Crowd Prediction (AI model: Binary Classification)**
   - We visit a shopping mall on different days and observe the crowd (data collection).
   - Using this data, we predict whether a particular day or week will be crowded and decide whether to visit or not.

3. **Animal Recognition (AI model: Multi-Class Classification)**
   - We have seen many animals in our lives and were taught their names and appearances (data collection).
   - Using this knowledge, we can identify animal names when visiting a zoo.

4. **Language Translation (AI model: Translation)**
   - Most Indians have learned at least two languages. one as their mother tongue and another (e.g., English) for education (data collection).
   - When a foreigner (e.g., from the US) visits our village and struggles with the local language, we translate for them.

5. **Forensic Sketching (AI model: Text-to-Image Generation)**
   - In movies, forensic sketch artists gather facial feature descriptions from witnesses (data collection).
   - Using these descriptions, he draws a face (similar to how AI models like DALLÂ·E generate images from text).

## AI Techniques Used ðŸ§ 

- Some tasks, like weight and crowd prediction, have clear mathematical relationships. AI interprets these relationships using simple Machine Learning techniques like **Linear Regression** and **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** etc.
- Other tasks, like language translation or image generation, do not have easily interpretable mathematical relationships. For such tasks, we use advanced AI techniques like **Neural Networks** (Transformers, ResNet, RNNs, etc.).
