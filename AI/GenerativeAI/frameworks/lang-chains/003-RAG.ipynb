    "# Let's Learn RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We know that **LLM (Large Language Models)** are trained on vast amounts of internet data and can perform most **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** tasks out of the box. However, in many cases, we have our **own data**, and we need LLMs to use this data to answer queries accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Can We Provide Our Data to an LLM?\n",
    "There are two primary ways to send our data to an LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **As part of the prompt message** üìù\n",
    "2. **Using tool calls** üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods work, but they have limitations. In dynamic applications, we often deal with **large amounts of data** that exceed an LLM's context window. Additionally, we might not always know **which specific context** to provide from a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) üîç\n",
    "To handle this challenge, we use a combination of tools to efficiently manage and retrieve relevant data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Text Splitter ‚úÇÔ∏è\n",
    "- Splits the context (aka data) into **meaningful chunks**.\n",
    "- The **chunk size** depends on the **semantic meaning** of the content and the **maximum context window** of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Embedding Models üß†\n",
    "- Converts text chunks into **machine-understandable numbers** (vectors).\n",
    "- These vectors help in searching and retrieving relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Vector Store üè¶\n",
    "- Stores the **vectors** generated by the embedding models.\n",
    "- When a query is made, it searches for **similar vectors** using **similarity metrics**.\n",
    "- This ensures that only **relevant chunks** are retrieved, reducing unnecessary data sent to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Overview üèóÔ∏è\n",
    "At a high level, RAG enhances LLM capabilities by:\n",
    "1. **Splitting** data into chunks.\n",
    "2. **Embedding** those chunks into vector representations.\n",
    "3. **Storing** them in a vector database.\n",
    "4. **Retrieving** relevant chunks dynamically when querying the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we **do not need to send the entire dataset** to the LLM, making the process more efficient and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Let's Start Coding! üíª\n",
    "Now that we understand the basics, let's dive into some hands-on coding to implement RAG effectively! üöÄ\n",
