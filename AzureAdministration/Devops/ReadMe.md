# Why is Project Management Important? 🚀

A business wants to buy custom software from a software company, and the company delivers it. The business gets the software, and the software company gets paid for it. This sounds like any other purchase we make in our daily lives, right? 🤔

For example:
- When we go to college, we need a laptop to do projects. We go to a store, buy it, and in return, the store gets money.
- If we need advanced Excel features, we buy Microsoft Office. We get the tools we need, and Microsoft gets money.

### Then why do we need project management? 🤷‍♂️

In the above examples, the end product is already built and battle-tested. The buyer looks at the features and decides to purchase it or not. But, when it comes to custom software development, things are different:
- Both the buyer (business) and the seller (software company) must collaborate to define the requirements.
- They need to decide what features must be built and agree on a tentative project delivery timeline.
- The software company has more responsibilities than the buyer because businesses only pay for the value they get from the project.

The software company must:
- Manage teams (tens or even hundreds of developers).
- Track the progress of work and resolve technical blockers.
- Deliver the product on time to ensure they get paid and, in turn, pay employees for their effort.
- Ensure everything from development to testing and deployment is done seamlessly.

For all these reasons, **project management** is crucial! ✅

## Waterfall Project Management Model 🌊

The **Waterfall model** follows a sequential approach:

1. 📋 The software company gathers requirements from the business.
2. ✍️ A formal requirement document is signed off.
3. 🏗️ The project architecture is designed by the architects.
4. 💻 Developers build the complete software.
5. 🧪 The software is tested, and any issues are fixed.
6. 🚀 The software is deployed and made available to the business.

### Issues with the Waterfall Model ⚠️

While this approach seems structured, it has significant drawbacks:
1. ❌ **Client dissatisfaction** – The final software might not meet expectations.
2. 🎨 **Bad UI/UX feedback** – The client may dislike the interface.
3. 🔄 **Requirement changes** – Business needs evolve due to market, political, or global situations.
4. 🛑 **Project cancellation** – The client might no longer need the software.
5. 🐞 **Post-deployment issues** – Problems may arise after launch.

**Research suggests that 60% of custom-built software projects fail to create a meaningful impact!** 📉

## Agile Project Management Model ⚡

To address the flaws of the Waterfall method, we have **Agile development**. In Agile, businesses don't have to wait for the entire software to be built before giving feedback. Instead, software development happens in **sprints** (typically every 2 weeks). 📆

### How Agile Works 🏃‍♂️
1. 🤝 Software companies hold meetings with the business at the beginning to get initial requirements.
2. Software is developed in sprints, with crucial components given top priority.
2. 🛠️ Each sprint delivers a **testable component** of the software.
3. 🗣️ Business provides early feedback, allowing changes without major rework.
4. 🔥 The most crucial components are built first.
5. 🚀 Once core features are ready, an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** is shared with the client.
6. 🔄 Further enhancements and additional features are developed in future sprints.
7. 🎉 Finally, the **full product release** happens.

### Benefits of Agile ✅
- **Early feedback** reduces misalignment between business needs and software features.
- **Flexibility** to accommodate requirement changes.
- **Faster time to market** since core functionalities are delivered early.
- **Higher client satisfaction** as they see progress in real-time.

With Agile, **everyone wins!** 🎯🚀
