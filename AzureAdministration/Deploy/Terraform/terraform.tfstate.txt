1.This `terraform.tfstate` file is created only when `terraform apply` command is executed successfully.

2.This file contains all sensitive information about resources deployed using this terraform.

3.If this file is lost while resources exist in azure, we have to use `terraform import` to generate this file again.
this process involves manual changes too.

4.For every other changes to this deployment, a file called `terraform.tfstate.backup` is created,
this contains previous working state of the deployment.

5.Since this is required and should not exist in git repo. we can use azure storage account as a place to store this state.
this feature is called remote state.

6.when we used azure storage account to store our state, we have a huge advantage, azure storage has a feature called lease. 
when this lease is active on a file, no other person even the contributor will not have write access to this file.
this makes sure that once one person can make change at any particular time and this change can be done by users with specific roles
