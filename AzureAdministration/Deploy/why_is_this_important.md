# 🚀 Why Write Code for Deployment Instead of Using Azure's UI?

Azure provides a beautiful UI for creating and managing resources, so why should we write code for deployment? Let's explore the reasons. 👇

## 🔹 When Should We Use Deployment Code?

1. **Scaling Up Deployments Efficiently**
   - When deploying **10-50 virtual machines or storage accounts** at once, using the UI is **time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious**.

2. **Avoiding Misconfigurations & Debugging Hassles**
   - Deploying multiple resources manually increases the risk of misconfigurations.
   - Fixing issues later can be **confusing and time-consuming**, especially when debugging under tight deadlines.

3. **Ensuring Idempotent Deployments**
   - Code-based deployments ensure that resources are deployed in an **idempotent manner** (i.e., running the script multiple times results in the same state).

4. **Efficiently Spinning Up & Tearing Down Resources**
   - You may need to **create and destroy resources dynamically** based on demand.
   - Example:
     
     🏡 **Imagine you're a realtor** who worked with a freelancer to build an AI assistant. This assistant analyzes your **bills (images), bank statements (PDFs), and other documents** and generates a PowerPoint presentation summarizing your **annual expenses, savings, EMIs, tax benefits, and estimated taxes**.
     
     - The AI assistant is a **web application**.
     - You only need it **once a year** before the fiscal year starts.
     - If the application **runs year-round, you'll be paying for it unnecessarily**.
     
     ✅ **Solution:** Use deployment scripts (like ARM templates) to **spin up the AI-powered web app only when needed** and **tear it down after use**—saving costs without needing software engineering skills.
     
     **Cool, right? 😎**

## 🎯 Perks of Using Deployment Code

1. **No Need to Worry About Resource Deployment Order** 🏗️
2. **Reusability** 🔁
   - Deployment scripts can be designed as **modules or functions** for reuse in other deployments.
3. **Run Shell Scripts in Deployment** 🖥️
   - Azure enables running shell scripts within deployment scripts using **Azure Storage Accounts and Azure Container Instances (ACI)**.
4. **Preview Changes Before Deployment** 🔍
5. **Track Changes with CI/CD Pipelines** 🚦
6. **Better Developer Experience** 👨‍💻
   - ARM templates (or better alternatives) contain a lot of syntax that is hard to remember.
   - Thankfully, **Azure provides VS Code extensions** to simplify the process! 🎉

### 📌 Conclusion
Using deployment code over Azure's UI offers automation, efficiency, and cost savings. While Azure UI is user-friendly, **writing deployment scripts scales better, ensures consistency, and reduces manual effort**. 🚀
