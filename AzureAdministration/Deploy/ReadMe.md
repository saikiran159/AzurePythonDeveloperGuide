# 🚀 Why Write Code for Deployment Instead of Using Azure's UI?

Azure provides a beautiful UI for creating and managing resources, so why should we write code for deployment? Let's explore the reasons. 👇

## 🔹 When Should We Use Deployment Code?

1. **Scaling Up Deployments Efficiently**
   - When deploying **10-50 virtual machines or storage accounts** at once, using the UI is **time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious**.

2. **Avoiding Misconfigurations & Debugging Hassles**
   - Deploying multiple resources manually increases the risk of misconfigurations.
   - Fixing issues later can be **confusing and time-consuming**, especially when debugging under tight deadlines.

3. **Ensuring Idempotent Deployments**
   - Code-based deployments ensure that resources are deployed in an **idempotent manner** (i.e., running the script multiple times results in the same state).

4. **Efficiently Spinning Up & Tearing Down Resources**
   - You may need to **create and destroy resources dynamically** based on demand.
   - Example:
     
     🏡 **Imagine you're a realtor** who worked with a freelancer to build an AI assistant. This assistant analyzes your **bills (images), bank statements (PDFs), and other documents** and generates a PowerPoint presentation summarizing your **annual expenses, savings, EMIs, tax benefits, and estimated taxes**.
     
     - The AI assistant is a **web application**.
     - You only need it **once a year** before the fiscal year starts.
     - If the application **runs year-round, you'll be paying for it unnecessarily**.
     
     ✅ **Solution:** Use deployment scripts (like ARM templates) to **spin up the AI-powered web app only when needed** and **tear it down after use**—saving costs without needing software engineering skills.
     
     **Cool, right? 😎**

## 🎯 Perks of Using Deployment Code

1. **No Need to Worry About Resource Deployment Order** 🏗️
2. **Reusability** 🔁
   - Deployment scripts can be designed as **modules or functions** for reuse in other deployments.
3. **Run Shell Scripts in Deployment** 🖥️
   - Azure enables running shell scripts within deployment scripts using **Azure Storage Accounts and Azure Container Instances (ACI)**.
4. **Preview Changes Before Deployment** 🔍
5. **Track Changes with CI/CD Pipelines** 🚦
6. **Better Developer Experience** 👨‍💻
   - ARM templates (or better alternatives) contain a lot of syntax that is hard to remember.
   - Thankfully, **Azure provides VS Code extensions** to simplify the process! 🎉
7. **Can Store deployment files for later use**
   - ARM templates support template specs, which can be used to store the templates in azure **resource group**.
   - From here, we can deploy the template with the resource group name where template spec is created and it's id.
   - Template specs can be done through **Azure portal** too

### 📌 Conclusion
Using deployment code over Azure's UI offers automation, efficiency, and cost savings. While Azure UI is user-friendly, **writing deployment scripts scales better, ensures consistency, and reduces manual effort**. 🚀

## 🔄 Managing the Lifecycle of ARM & Bicep Templates

### 📌 **Template Specs (Latest Feature)**
1. Enables **version control** for ARM and Bicep templates.
2. **Role-based access** can be assigned for managing deployments.
3. Allows linking a **main template** to a template stored in **Template Spec**.
4. Deployment can be done using **Azure Portal, SDK, CLI, or REST API**.
5. When creating a **Template Spec**, it automatically includes **linked templates**.
6. **Best Practice:** Use **modular Template Specs** since there is a **2MB size limit**.

---

### ❌ **Azure Blueprints (Being Deprecated in 2026)**
1. Requires **ARM templates in JSON format** (either local or from GitHub).
2. Supports lifecycle management via **Azure Portal, SDK, REST API**, etc.
3. Key components:
   - **Role:** Defines who manages the blueprint.
   - **Policy:** Determines rules applied at different scopes.
   - **Resources:** Defined in ARM templates.
4. **Blueprint Lifecycle:**
   - Created in **Draft mode** with a version.
   - After deployment, it moves to **Published mode**.
   - Editing creates a **new draft version**, which must be **deployed** to take effect.
5. **Locking:**
   - Blueprints can be locked.
   - Locks apply to all policies and resources.
6. **Deletion:**
   - Deleting a Blueprint **does not delete** resources but **removes all locks**.

---

### 🔄 **Azure Deployment Stacks (Replacement for Blueprints)**
1. Supports **Bicep, ARM Templates, or Template Specs** for resource deployment.
2. **Scope Rules:**
   - If deploying **resources** → Deployment Stack **scope = Resource Group**.
   - If deploying **Resource Groups** → Deployment Stack **scope = Subscription**.
   - If deploying **Resource Groups across subscriptions** → Deployment Stack **scope = Management Group**.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Assign roles to control **who can manage** the deployment stack.
4. **Resource Management When Deleting Deployment Stack:**
   - `deleteAll` → Deletes **resources** and **resource groups**.
   - `deleteResources` → Deletes **only resources**, keeping resource groups.
   - `detachAll` → Detaches resources but keeps them in Azure (unmanaged).
5. **Resource Locking Options:**
   - `none` → No restrictions (can modify/delete resources).
   - `denyDelete` → Prevents deletion (control-plane level only).
   - `denyWriteAndDelete` → Prevents both modifications and deletion.
   - **Additional options** for **data-level locks** are available.

---

### 🏁 **Conclusion**
- **Bicep is superior to ARM Templates** and is **Microsoft's recommended tool**.
- **Terraform is more flexible** for multi-cloud deployments and **offers advanced state management**.
- **Azure Blueprints are being retired in 2026**; use **Deployment Stacks** instead for **modern IaC management**.

🚀 **Stay updated and choose the right tool for your cloud deployment needs!**

# Miscellaneous Tools in DevOps 🚀

## Infrastructure Lifecycle Management in Azure

To manage the entire lifecycle of Azure infrastructure, we typically use **ARM templates**, **Bicep**, or **Terraform**, depending on our preference. These tools are particularly effective for **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** solutions. However, when dealing with **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** solutions like **Virtual Machines (VMs) and Scale Sets**, we need additional tools to handle configuration drift.

## Challenges in IaaS Deployments ⚠️

While deployment tools such as ARM templates, Bicep, and Terraform help manage infrastructure, they do not solve configuration drift issues. Configuration drift occurs when changes are made to the infrastructure outside of the deployment tools, leading to inconsistencies.

### Example Scenario 📌
Imagine a company sets up a **server** for developers to build and test applications. The application consists of multiple components, each managed by a different team member. Here are some potential issues that may arise:

- Two developers require **Node.js** but need different versions. If they install them separately, one version may overwrite the other.
- Networking settings configured by one person might inadvertently impact another component of the application.
- A system update or an unknown change could modify a critical dependency like Node.js, affecting application functionality.

## Solution: Azure Automation & Desired State Configuration (DSC) 🛠️

To address these challenges, Azure provides **Azure Automation**, which includes a feature called **Desired State Configuration (DSC)**. This tool helps maintain consistent configurations across Windows and Linux machines.

### How DSC Works ✅
1. **Define Requirements** – Specify application and system configuration requirements in a declarative syntax.
2. **Compile Configuration** – Convert the configuration into a machine-readable format.
3. **Apply to Nodes** – Deploy the configuration to target machines.
4. **Ensure Compliance** – DSC continuously monitors the state of the machines to ensure compliance.
5. **Handle Non-Compliance** – Define actions for non-compliance (e.g., automatic correction or alerting).
6. **Monitoring & Alerts** – Integrate with Azure Monitor to receive notifications about configuration drift.

### Benefits of DSC 🌟
- **Consistency** – Ensures all machines adhere to the defined configuration.
- **Automation** – Reduces manual intervention by automating configuration enforcement.
- **Scalability** – Works across multiple Windows and Linux nodes.
- **Integration** – Can be combined with monitoring tools for better visibility and control.

By leveraging **Azure Automation DSC**, organizations can maintain a stable and predictable infrastructure, minimizing the risks associated with configuration drift. 🚀
