# 🚀 Welcome to My Python & Azure Journey! 🌟  

Hello, fellow developers! 👋  

This repository is my personal knowledge hub, where I explore everything from Python fundamentals to cutting-edge AI topics, all while embracing the power of **Microsoft Azure**! ☁️💙  

## 🐍 Python: From Basics to Mastery  
Whether you're just starting with Python or diving into advanced topics, this repo will cover it all:  
✅ Core Python concepts  
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
✅ Async programming (asyncio)  
✅ CLI scripting for automation  
✅ Flask for API development  
...and much more!  

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning on Azure  
As an **Azure enthusiast**, I’ll explore AI topics using both **open-source** and **Azure AI services**:  
🔹 Machine Learning (ML)  
🔹 Deep Learning (DL)  
🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
🔹 Generative AI (GenAI)  
🔹 Large Language Models (LLMs)  

## ☁️ Azure Deployment Strategies  
Azure offers multiple ways to deploy applications, and I’ll cover them all:  
🚀 **IaaS** (Virtual Machines, Load Balancers)  
🚀 **PaaS** (Azure App Service, Functions)  
🚀 **ARM Templates & Terraform**  

## 🔄 DevOps Through the Azure Lens  
A successful project isn’t just about coding—it’s about **efficient DevOps**!  
🔄 CI/CD with Azure DevOps & GitHub Actions  
🔄 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform  
🔄 Monitoring & Logging (App Insights, Log Analytics)
